NAME
    MooseX::AttributeShortcuts - Shorthand for common attribute options

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.014 of MooseX::AttributeShortcuts -
    released August 16, 2012 as part of MooseX-AttributeShortcuts.

SYNOPSIS
        package Some::Class;

        use Moose;
        use MooseX::AttributeShortcuts;

        # same as:
        #   is => 'ro', lazy => 1, builder => '_build_foo'
        has foo => (is => 'lazy');

        # same as: is => 'ro', writer => '_set_foo'
        has foo => (is => 'rwp');

        # same as: is => 'ro', builder => '_build_bar'
        has bar => (is => 'ro', builder => 1);

        # same as: is => 'ro', clearer => 'clear_bar'
        has bar => (is => 'ro', clearer => 1);

        # same as: is => 'ro', predicate => 'has_bar'
        has bar => (is => 'ro', predicate => 1);

        # works as you'd expect for "private": predicate => '_has_bar'
        has _bar => (is => 'ro', predicate => 1);

        # extending? Use the "Shortcuts" trait alias
        extends 'Some::OtherClass';
        has '+bar' => (traits => [Shortcuts], builder => 1, ...);

        # or...
        package Some::Other::Class;

        use Moose;
        use MooseX::AttributeShortcuts -writer_prefix => '_';

        # same as: is => 'ro', writer => '_foo'
        has foo => (is => 'rwp');

DESCRIPTION
    Ever find yourself repeatedly specifying writers and builders, because
    there's no good shortcut to specifying them? Sometimes you want an
    attribute to have a read-only public interface, but a private writer.
    And wouldn't it be easier to just say "builder => 1" and have the
    attribute construct the canonical "_build_$name" builder name for you?

    This package causes an attribute trait to be applied to all attributes
    defined to the using class. This trait extends the attribute option
    processing to handle the above variations.

USAGE
    This package automatically applies an attribute metaclass trait. Unless
    you want to change the defaults, you can ignore the talk about
    "prefixes" below.

EXTENDING A CLASS
    If you're extending a class and trying to extend its attributes as well,
    you'll find out that the trait is only applied to attributes defined
    locally in the class. This package exports a trait shortcut function
    "Shortcuts" that will help you apply this to the extended attribute:

        has '+something' => (traits => [Shortcuts], ...);

PREFIXES
    We accept two parameters on the use of this module; they impact how
    builders and writers are named.

  -writer_prefix
        use MooseX::::AttributeShortcuts -writer_prefix => 'prefix';

    The default writer prefix is '_set_'. If you'd prefer it to be something
    else (say, '_'), this is where you'd do that.

  -builder_prefix
        use MooseX::::AttributeShortcuts -builder_prefix => 'prefix';

    The default builder prefix is '_build_', as this is what lazy_build
    does, and what people in general recognize as build methods.

NEW ATTRIBUTE OPTIONS
    Unless specified here, all options defined by Moose::Meta::Attribute and
    Class::MOP::Attribute remain unchanged.

    Want to see additional options? Ask, or better yet, fork on GitHub and
    send a pull request.

    For the following, "$name" should be read as the attribute name; and the
    various prefixes should be read using the defaults.

  is => 'rwp'
    Specifying "is => 'rwp'" will cause the following options to be set:

        is     => 'ro'
        writer => "_set_$name"

  is => 'lazy'
    Specifying "is => 'lazy'" will cause the following options to be set:

        is       => 'ro'
        builder  => "_build_$name"
        lazy     => 1

    NOTE: Since 0.009 we no longer set "init_arg => undef" if no "init_arg"
    is explicitly provided. This is a change made in parallel with Moo,
    based on a large number of people surprised that lazy also made one's
    "init_def" undefined.

  is => 'lazy', default => ...
    Specifying "is => 'lazy'" and a default will cause the following options
    to be set:

        is       => 'ro'
        lazy     => 1
        default  => ... # as provided

    That is, if you specify "is => 'lazy'" and also provide a "default",
    then we won't try to set a builder, as well.

  builder => 1
    Specifying "builder => 1" will cause the following options to be set:

        builder => "_build_$name"

  clearer => 1
    Specifying "clearer => 1" will cause the following options to be set:

        clearer => "clear_$name"

    or, if your attribute name begins with an underscore:

        clearer => "_clear$name"

    (that is, an attribute named "_foo" would get "_clear_foo")

  predicate => 1
    Specifying "predicate => 1" will cause the following options to be set:

        predicate => "has_$name"

    or, if your attribute name begins with an underscore:

        predicate => "_has$name"

    (that is, an attribute named "_foo" would get "_has_foo")

  trigger => 1
    Specifying "trigger => 1" will cause the attribute to be created with a
    trigger that calls a named method in the class with the options passed
    to the trigger. By default, the method name the trigger calls is the
    name of the attribute prefixed with "_trigger_".

    e.g., for an attribute named "foo" this would be equivalent to:

        trigger => sub { shift->_trigger_foo(@_) }

    For an attribute named "_foo":

        trigger => sub { shift->_trigger__foo(@_) }

    This naming scheme, in which the trigger is always private, is the same
    as the builder naming scheme (just with a different prefix).
