Revision history for MooseX-AttributeShortcuts

0.005     2011-08-18 20:54:02 America/Los_Angeles
    * handle attribute extension/cloning, for realz this time
    * we now handle the case of attributes defined in roles by properly
      applying our trait to the applied_attribute metaclass

0.004     2011-08-02 23:44:20 America/Los_Angeles
    * add lazy_build => 'private'
    * our laziness was being ignored when an attribute defined in one class
      was being extended/cloned in another class -- this could not stand

0.003     2011-07-03 16:40:19 America/Los_Angeles
    * handle predicate => 1, clearer => 1 as well

0.002     2011-03-30 23:43:11 America/Los_Angeles
    * Convert our trait to a parameterized role, to allow for different
      build and writer prefixes (e.g. '_set_' vs '_')
    * Cause 'is => "lazy"' to behave the way it does in Moo
    * Change the default writer prefix from _ to _set_; it was pointed out
      that this is the expected way to do things (and makes more sense,
      really).

0.001     2011-03-27 08:12:11 America/Los_Angeles
    * initial release
